# AWS S3 Media Uploads
The S3 class instructs Wordpress to upload media straight to an AWS S3 bucket. To use:

1. create an S3 bucket
2. Attach a policy to the bucket. Example:

        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": "*",
                    "Action": [
                        "s3:GetObject"
                    ],
                    "Resource": [
                        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }

3. Create an IAM-user
4. Attach a user policy to the IAM-user. Example:

        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Sid": "Stmt1407599749000",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
              ]
            },
            {
              "Sid": "Stmt1407599782000",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }

5. Create an access-key for the user and keep the credentials safe
6. Configure `Common/Config/S3.php` with credentials generated.

Things to note:
- Only new media is uploaded. Old media will need to be manually uploaded and the urls updated in the database
- The url path structure is identical to that used by Wordpress. The only difference is in the domain. For example: https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/11/beans.png
