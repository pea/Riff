# Api

The Api class allows you to simply create endpoints at /api which call matching classes. Extending the Api class will create an endpoint (see [Examples/Api/userLogout.php](../Examples/Api/userLogout.php)).

Notez

- [WP Rest API](http://v2.wp-api.org/extending/adding/) is a fully featured option and should be considered.
